# Crazy Bike

This repo is the demo code presented at **Techorama BE 2022**:

https://techorama.be/agenda/session/deploy-azure-container-apps-with-pulumi/  

Crazy Bike is a service to produce, assemble and ship random bikes.  
The example uses [Azure Container Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/overview) to host different worker services.  
Container apps are deployed in an IAAC fashion using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/).
